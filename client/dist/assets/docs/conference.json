We'll cover the basics of rendering scenes and objects with lighting, textures and cameras; as well as interacting with them using directly and indirectly through the use of physics engines.

In this session, we'll learn:<br/><br/><ol><li>What 'Virtual DOM' is and why it matters</li><li>How you can begin making use of it now, in your existing environments</li><li>How React also thinks differently about data-binding, with its 'one-way reactive data flow'</li></ol><br/>Longer-Term, React combined with the 'Flux' pattern points the way to a very different style of front-end application development than we're used to now: very modular, 'component'-driven architectures. At the same time, one of the signal traits of React/Flux is that more and more of the application is contained exclusively in Javascript files: React's HTML elements are declared as either 'JSX' templates, or just as Javascript objects. And some folks are taking this on to the next level, even programming all of their CSS in JS as well! Before this session is over, you'll see how all these pieces fit together and how you can build some very effective, very fast, and very maintainable components and apps this way. That said, we'll also discuss what's still missing from the React/Flux ecosystem, and provide you with a roadmap that allows you decide when you can - and when you can't - build your whole application around it."

Yet many people are not able to understand the performance gotchas completely, and don’t make it a part of their deployment process to measure the rendering performance of their webpages. In this workshop, participants will Performance Audit Web Applications to make them run them at 60fps. Workshop will consist of: Understand the working behind several jQuery functions and their performance impacts. Profiling with Dev Tools available in Browsers, to explore the rendering issues and their respective remedies. Discussion of case studies of already audited web applications, and discuss their performance remedies as well. Live Audit of Web applications by Workshop attendees."

In this workshop we'll learn how to leverage WebGL directly, and also how to utilise it through one of it's most useful abstraction layers: ThreeJS. We'll cover the basics of rendering scenes and objects with lighting, textures and cameras; as well as interacting with them using directly and indirectly through the use of physics engines. You should come away from this talk with a thirst to learn more about this powerful technology, as well as a basic foundation of skills and knowledge to assist you in that exploration in building your own applications and games. In order to take the most from this talk, you should have a good understanding of browser JavaScript API's (the DOM API et al) as well as the heart not to be discouraged when we occasionally use phrases like 'matrix manipulation' and 'vector transforms'."

In this session, we'll learn:<br/><br/><ol><li>What 'Virtual DOM' is and why it matters</li><li>How you can begin making use of it now, in your existing environments</li><li>How React also thinks differently about data-binding, with its 'one-way reactive data flow'</li></ol><br/>Longer-Term, React combined with the 'Flux' pattern points the way to a very different style of front-end application development than we're used to now: very modular, 'component'-driven architectures. At the same time, one of the signal traits of React/Flux is that more and more of the application is contained exclusively in Javascript files: React's HTML elements are declared as either 'JSX' templates, or just as Javascript objects. And some folks are taking this on to the next level, even programming all of their CSS in JS as well! Before this session is over, you'll see how all these pieces fit together and how you can build some very effective, very fast, and very maintainable components and apps this way. That said, we'll also discuss what's still missing from the React/Flux ecosystem, and provide you with a roadmap that allows you decide when you can - and when you can't - build your whole application around it."
